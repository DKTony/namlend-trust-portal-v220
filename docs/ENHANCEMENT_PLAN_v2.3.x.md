# Enhancement Plan — v2.3.x

Version: Final v1 • Date: 2025-10-09 • Owner: Engineering • Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Objectives

- Improve data fidelity (pull real employment status; unify queries)
- Enhance UX responsiveness (skeletons, loading indicators, retryable errors)
- Add discoverability (filters by date/amount/priority)
- Enable realtime experiences (auto-refresh for approvals and payments)
- Maintain security posture (RLS, 32% APR, no role escalation)

## Phase 1 (v2.3.0) — UX & Data Quality

- Employment status from `profiles`
  - Update `useLoanApplications.ts` to join `profiles.employment_status` for:
    - Pending items (from `approval_requests_expanded` via `user_id`)
    - Approved/Rejected/Disbursed items (from `loans.user_id`)
  - Surface in `LoanApplicationsList.tsx` badges and `LoanDetailsModal`.
  - Acceptance: Pending/approved items display non-mock employment status.

- Loading states & error recovery
  - Skeleton loader for `LoanApplicationsList` (pending tab primary, reuse for others).
  - Ensure `PaymentOverview` loading shimmer displays while fetching.
  - Error cards with Retry (calls `refetch`) for Loans and Payments.
  - Acceptance: Loading visible < 100ms after mount; Retry re-issues queries and clears error.

- Enhanced filtering
  - Date range filter (created_at) for pending approvals.
  - Amount range filter (NAD) across tabs.
  - Priority filter (approvals only).
  - Persist filter state in URL or local storage for session continuity.
  - Acceptance: Filters compound correctly and are reflected in queries.

## Phase 2 (v2.3.1) — Unified Data Model

- SQL view: `loan_applications_unified`
  - UNION of:
    - approval stage: `approval_requests` where request_type = 'loan_application' and status in ('pending', 'under_review')
    - loan stage: `loans` where status in ('approved','rejected','disbursed')
  - Columns (normalized):
    - id, user_id, source ('approval'|'loan'), status, amount, purpose, priority, term_months, interest_rate,
      created_at, updated_at, applicant_name (via profiles), applicant_email (via profiles)
  - Security: SECURITY INVOKER; inherits RLS; GRANT SELECT to authenticated; indexes on (status, created_at DESC).

- Frontend refactor
  - `useLoanApplications.ts` reads from unified view for all tabs.
  - Feature flag fallback to existing logic for safe rollback.
  - Acceptance: One hook, consistent counts across tabs and portfolio cards.

## Phase 3 (v2.3.2) — Realtime Updates

- Supabase Realtime subscriptions
  - `approval_requests` (insert/update) → Pending Review auto-refresh.
  - `payments` (insert/update) → Payment Overview totals and list live-update.
  - Throttle refresh to avoid flicker; show toast: "New items available" with manual refresh option.
  - Acceptance: New requests or payments appear within 3 seconds without manual refresh.

## Implementation Details

- Files likely to change
  - Hooks: `src/pages/AdminDashboard/hooks/useLoanApplications.ts`, `useLoanPortfolioMetrics.ts`, `usePaymentMetrics.ts`
  - Components: `LoanApplicationsList.tsx`, `LoanManagementDashboard.tsx`, `PaymentOverview.tsx`, shared `DateRangePicker` and `AmountRange` inputs
  - Modals: `LoanDetailsModal` (accept employment field)
  - SQL: `supabase/migrations/*_loan_applications_unified.sql`

- Security and RLS
  - No write-path changes; read-only enhancements
  - View inherits RLS from `approval_requests`, `loans`, `profiles`
  - No role changes; maintain existing auth flows

## Testing Strategy

- Unit
  - Transform mapping for unified view → UI model
  - Filter predicate composition (date/amount/priority)
- E2E (Playwright)
  - Filters (all combinations), skeleton loaders, retry behavior
  - Realtime: insert/update events produce auto-refresh within SLA
- Performance
  - Ensure view queries use indexes; monitor query time budget (< 200ms typical)

## Rollout Plan

- v2.3.0 (1 week): employment status, skeletons, retry, filters
- v2.3.1 (1–1.5 weeks): unified view + hook refactor
- v2.3.2 (1 week): realtime subscriptions + UX

## Acceptance Criteria Summary

- Employment status is real and consistent across views
- Skeletons and loading indicators are visible until data resolves
- Errors present clear messaging and Retry works
- Filters persist and affect queries accurately
- Unified view yields consistent counts and simpler hook code
- Realtime updates reflect within 3s without page refresh

## Risks & Mitigations

- View correctness and RLS behavior → QA in staging, read-only view, feature-flag fallback
- Realtime over-refresh → throttle/debounce, toast-based manual refresh option
- Filter complexity → isolate in hook and unit-test thoroughly

## Tracking

- See project TODOs for task-level status; CHANGELOG to document versioned milestones.
