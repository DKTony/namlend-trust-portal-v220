- Updated APR messaging to explicitly cap at 32% per Namibian regulation.

### Changes Implemented

- `tailwind.config.ts`: refined container padding for smaller screens; preserved existing breakpoints and theme extensions.
- `src/components/Header.tsx`: improved mobile tap targets (44px+), added proper ARIA attributes and keyboard focus ring; ensured menu open/close does not induce horizontal scroll.
- `src/components/Footer.tsx`: adjusted link spacing/tap targets; updated APR copy to “Representative APR: up to 32% p.a.”

## Recent Development Progress Archive

### Historical: Role Assignment System Resolution - Complete

**Date**: September 7, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY & VALIDATED**

**Objective**: Resolve critical Supabase role assignment errors and implement a reliable, secure role management mechanism for the NamLend Trust platform.

#### Major Achievements

**Critical Issues Resolved:**

- ✅ Fixed 404 error for `assign_user_role` PostgreSQL function - bypassed with direct service role approach
- ✅ Resolved schema mismatch errors with `updated_at` field references in user_roles table
- ✅ Eliminated Row-Level Security (RLS) conflicts preventing role assignments
- ✅ Implemented working multi-role support allowing users to have multiple roles simultaneously

**Technical Solutions Implemented:**

- **Delete-Then-Insert Pattern**: Adopted robust approach to avoid update triggers and schema conflicts
- **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: Created extensive test utilities for development and production verification
- **Multi-Role Support**: Confirmed users can hold multiple roles (e.g., 'client' and 'admin') for flexible access control

#### Technical Impact

**Database Operations:**

- Role assignments now use direct service role client operations instead of missing PostgreSQL functions
- Eliminated dependency on `assign_user_role` function that was not deployed to production
- Maintained strict RLS policies while enabling elevated operations via service role key

**Frontend Integration:**

- Role assignment system fully integrated with authentication flows and React Router navigation
- Multi-role support enables sophisticated access control and UI routing logic
- User roles properly cached and managed in frontend state management

**Development & Testing:**

- Created comprehensive test utilities in `testRoleAssignment.ts` for development verification
- Added Node.js test script for backend role assignment validation
- Implemented development flags to gate testing utilities from production builds

#### Files Modified

## Security Implementation

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

- **Enabled on all tables** with appropriate policies
- Users can only access their own data
- Staff roles can access relevant operational data
- Admin roles have broad system access

### Current Security Status

Based on the security review, there are several **CRITICAL** vulnerabilities:

#### **CRITICAL Issues**

1. **Auto-Admin Role Assignment**: All new users automatically receive admin privileges
2. **Role Escalation**: Users can select any role during signup/login
3. **Security Definer Views**: Two database views with security risks

#### **Minor Issues**

- OTP expiry configuration needs adjustment
- Leaked password protection disabled

## Edge Functions (Backend Logic)

### **process-loan-application**

- Serverless function for loan processing
- Automatically reviews loan applications
- All applications currently go to manual review (no auto-approval)
- Creates notifications and audit trails
- Integrates with loan review system

### **send-notification**

- Notification delivery system
- Email integration placeholder
- System-wide communication management

## Current System State

### Users & Data

- **Total Users**: 1
- **User Roles**: 1 admin (critical security issue)
- **Loans**: 5 pending applications
- **Financial Summary**: NAD 0 disbursed, 5 total loans pending

### Authentication Flow

1. User registers with role selection
2. **VULNERABILITY**: Role is automatically assigned without validation
3. Profile created with basic information
4. User redirected to appropriate dashboard

### Loan Processing Flow

1. Client submits application via multi-step form
2. Edge function processes application
3. All applications routed to manual review
4. Loan officers review via admin dashboard
5. Status updates trigger notifications
6. Approved loans enter disbursement process

## Strengths

1. **Modern Architecture**: Well-structured React application with TypeScript
2. **Comprehensive Feature Set**: Complete loan management workflow
3. **User Experience**: Clean, professional interface with good UX patterns
4. **Database Design**: Well-normalized database with proper relationships
5. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and audit capabilities
6. **Scalability**: Built on Supabase for easy scaling
7. **Namibian Market Focus**: Localized for NAD currency and regulations

## Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **Role Escalation**: Any user can become admin during signup/login
2. **Auto-Admin Assignment**: System automatically grants admin privileges
3. **Access Control Bypass**: Role selection UI allows privilege escalation
4. **Database Views**: Security definer views present potential risks

## Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions Required**

1. **Remove role selection** from authentication forms
2. **Disable auto-admin assignment** trigger
3. **Audit existing users** and correct role assignments
4. **Implement proper admin creation** process

### **Security Hardening**

1. Fix Security Definer views
2. Configure OTP expiry properly  
3. Enable leaked password protection
4. Add comprehensive input validation
5. Implement rate limiting

### **Feature Enhancements**
