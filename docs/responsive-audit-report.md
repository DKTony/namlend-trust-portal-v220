# NamLend Trust – Responsive Design Audit (v2.2.3)

**Date:** 2025-09-27  
**Author:** Cascade  
**Scope:** Public routes (`/`, `/auth`), header and footer components  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (no horizontal overflow detected)  

---

## 1. Objectives

- Validate responsive rendering across common mobile and tablet breakpoints.
- Eliminate horizontal scrolling and layout truncation.
- Verify accessible tap targets and keyboard focus visibility.
- Align APR messaging with Namibian regulatory cap (≤ 32% APR).

## 2. Methodology

- Manual inspection using Puppeteer to resize viewport and capture screenshots.
- Programmatic check for `document.documentElement.scrollWidth > window.innerWidth` to detect horizontal overflow.
- Menu open/close validation for `src/components/Header.tsx` (mobile hamburger).

## 3. Viewports & Routes Tested

- Viewports: 320×640, 375×667, 390×844, 414×896, 640×360, 768×1024, 1024×768
- Routes: `/` (Home), `/auth` (Authentication)
- Result: ✅ No horizontal overflow detected at any viewport, including with the mobile menu expanded.

## 4. Findings

- **Layout Reflow:** Hero, CTAs, trust indicators and loan card reflow cleanly. No content truncation.
- **Header Menu:** Mobile drawer opens without pushing content beyond viewport width.
- **Tap Targets:** Header and footer primary actions meet ≥44px target size; focus ring visible.
- **Typography & Spacing:** Readable at all test sizes; container padding refined for small screens.
- **Compliance Copy:** APR references updated to reflect ≤32% cap.

## 5. Code Changes

- `tailwind.config.ts`
  - Adjusted container padding for small screens; preserved breakpoints and theme extensions.
- `src/components/Header.tsx`
  - Larger tap targets (`h-11 w-11`), accessible labels, `aria-expanded`, focus ring; menu tested for overflow.
- `src/components/Footer.tsx`
  - Increased link hit areas; updated APR copy to: “Representative APR: up to 32% p.a.”
- `src/components/HeroSection.tsx`
  - Updated APR note to: “Representative APR: up to 32% p.a.”

## 6. Accessibility Notes

- **Focus Management:** Focus rings visible on interactive controls (buttons/links).
- **ARIA:** Mobile menu button provides `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls`.
- **Touch Targets:** Buttons and primary links ≥44px; consistent spacing in footer lists.

## 7. Compliance

- All APR messaging now capped at 32%:
  - `HeroSection.tsx` → “Representative APR: up to 32% p.a.”
  - `Footer.tsx` → “Representative APR: up to 32% p.a.”
- Loan Calculator example rate remains at 28% p.a. (within cap).

## 8. Risks & Deferred Items

- **Protected Routes Untested (UI):** `/dashboard` and `/admin` responsive checks pending an authenticated session.
- **Automation:** CI automation for viewport screenshots and horizontal overflow detection is pending.

## 9. Next Steps

1. Add CI job to run Puppeteer-based viewport tests and store screenshots as artifacts.
2. Repeat the same audit on `/dashboard` and `/admin` after sign-in.
3. Optionally add a global safeguard (only if needed later): `body { overflow-x: hidden; }`—not necessary currently.

## 10. Artifact Locations

- Source of truth for updates:
  - `docs/context.md` → v2.2.3 running log and compliance summary.
  - `docs/Executive Summary.md` → “UI Responsiveness & Compliance (v2.2.3)”.
  - `docs/CHANGELOG.md` → v2.2.3 entry.
  - `docs/README.md` → index updated to v2.2.3 with summary.
