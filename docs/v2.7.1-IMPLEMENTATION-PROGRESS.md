## Week 1: Foundation (Oct 20-26) âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Task 1: Schema Alignment Verification
**Status:** Completed  
**Commits:** `807fac4`

**Findings:**
- âœ… Web app clean (no legacy fields in active code)
- âœ… Mobile app: Fixed `LoanDetailsScreen.tsx` using `payment.payment_date` â†’ `payment.paid_at`
- âœ… `AdminDashboard_broken.tsx` confirmed unused (not imported anywhere)
- âœ… `outstanding_balance` only in RPC return types and DB views (acceptable)

**Actions Taken:**
- Fixed mobile schema alignment
- Added fallback for unpaid schedule items

### âœ… Task 2: CI Expansion
**Status:** Completed  
**Commits:** `709bd97`

**Workflows Created:**
1. **ci-web.yml** - Web application CI
   - Lint & TypeCheck (ESLint + tsc)
   - Unit tests (Vitest)
   - Playwright API smoke tests
   - Schema alignment check (prevents legacy fields)

2. **ci-mobile.yml** - Mobile application CI
   - Lint & TypeCheck (React Native/Expo)
   - Schema alignment check
   - Metro config validation
   - Optional EAS build trigger on tags

**Quality Gates:**
- All PRs must pass lint, typecheck, unit tests
- Schema drift prevented automatically
- API smoke tests validate critical flows

**Status:** Pending  
**Owner:** Platform Team

**Scope:**
- Add integration tests for documents table RLS

- Ensure clients cannot read others' data

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Clients cannot read others' documents
- [ ] Clients cannot read others' disbursements

- [ ] Storage policies prevent cross-tenant uploads
- [ ] Tests fail if RLS policies regress

### ðŸ”² Task 4: Unified Supabase Types
**Status:** Pending  
**Owner:** Engineering

**Scope:**
- Generate types from live Supabase schema
- Adopt in web: `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
- Adopt in mobile: `namlend-mobile/src/types/`
- Replace ad-hoc types in services

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Types regenerated on schema change
- [ ] Services compile without `any` around DB payloads
- [ ] CI checks for type drift

## Week 3: Backoffice Disbursement (Oct 20) âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Task 5: Backoffice Disbursement UI
**Status:** Completed  
**Commits:** `c7c3da8`, `283fbfd`  
**Owner:** Web Frontend Team  
**Priority:** HIGH

**Objective:**
Enable backoffice (admin/loan_officer) to disburse approved loans so funds are transferred to clients and loan moves to `disbursed` state.

**Implementation Plan:**

#### UI Changes
**File:** `src/pages/AdminDashboard/components/LoanManagement/LoanManagementDashboard.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Add "Disburse" action button for loans where:
   - `loan.status === 'approved'`
   - `!loan.disbursed_at`

2. Wire to existing modal:
   - Reuse `PaymentManagement/CompleteDisbursementModal.tsx`
   - OR integrate with `PaymentManagement/DisbursementManager.tsx`

3. Modal captures:
   - Disbursement method (bank_transfer, mobile_money, cash)
   - Reference number
   - Notes (optional)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] "Disburse" button visible for approved, non-disbursed loans
- [ ] Modal opens with loan details pre-filled
- [ ] Form validates method and reference
- [ ] Success/error feedback displayed

---

### âœ… Task 6: Backoffice Disbursement RPC
**Status:** Completed  
**Commits:** `c7c3da8`  
**Owner:** Platform Team  
**Priority:** HIGH

**Objective:**
Create secure RPC to record disbursement and update loan status.

**Implementation Plan:**

#### Database RPC
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251020_create_perform_disbursement_rpc.sql`

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION perform_disbursement(
  p_loan_id UUID,
  p_amount NUMERIC,
  p_method TEXT,
  p_reference TEXT,
  p_notes TEXT DEFAULT NULL
)
RETURNS JSON
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
  v_user_id UUID;
  v_user_role TEXT;
  v_loan RECORD;
  v_disbursement_id UUID;
BEGIN
  -- Get current user
  v_user_id := auth.uid();
  
  -- Check role (admin or loan_officer only)
  SELECT role INTO v_user_role
  FROM user_roles
  WHERE user_id = v_user_id
  LIMIT 1;
  
  IF v_user_role NOT IN ('admin', 'loan_officer') THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Unauthorized: Only admin or loan_officer can disburse loans';
  END IF;
  
  -- Get loan details
  SELECT * INTO v_loan
  FROM loans
  WHERE id = p_loan_id
  AND status = 'approved'
  AND disbursed_at IS NULL;
  
  IF NOT FOUND THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Loan not found or already disbursed';
  END IF;
  
  -- Validate amount matches loan
  IF p_amount != v_loan.amount THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Disbursement amount must match loan amount';
  END IF;
  
  -- Create disbursement record
  INSERT INTO disbursements (
    loan_id,
    amount,
    method,
    reference,
    notes,
    processed_by,
    processed_at,
    status
  ) VALUES (
    p_loan_id,
    p_amount,
    p_method,
    p_reference,
    p_notes,
    v_user_id,
    NOW(),
    'completed'
  )
  RETURNING id INTO v_disbursement_id;
  
  -- Update loan status
  UPDATE loans
  SET 
    disbursed_at = NOW(),
    status = 'disbursed',
    updated_at = NOW()
  WHERE id = p_loan_id;
  
  -- Create audit trail
  INSERT INTO audit_logs (
    user_id,
    action,
    entity_type,
    entity_id,
    metadata
  ) VALUES (
    v_user_id,
    'disburse_loan',
    'loan',
    p_loan_id,
    jsonb_build_object(
      'disbursement_id', v_disbursement_id,
      'amount', p_amount,
      'method', p_method,
      'reference', p_reference
    )
  );
  
  RETURN json_build_object(
    'success', true,
    'disbursement_id', v_disbursement_id,
    'loan_id', p_loan_id,
    'message', 'Loan disbursed successfully'
  );
END;
$$;
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] RPC enforces role checks (admin/loan_officer only)
- [ ] Validates loan is approved and not yet disbursed
- [ ] Creates disbursement record with all metadata
- [ ] Updates `loans.disbursed_at` and status to `disbursed`
- [ ] Creates audit trail entry
- [ ] Returns success/error JSON

### âœ… Task 7: Backoffice Disbursement E2E Tests
**Status:** Completed  
**Commits:** `d21eb86`  
**Owner:** QA Team  
**Priority:** HIGH

**Objective:**
Ensure disbursement flow works end-to-end and RLS is enforced.

**Test Cases:**

#### API Tests (`e2e/api/disbursement.e2e.ts`)
```typescript
describe('Disbursement API', () => {
  test('admin can disburse approved loan', async () => {
    // Setup: Create approved loan
    // Action: Call perform_disbursement RPC
    // Assert: Loan status = 'disbursed', disbursed_at set
  });
  
  test('loan_officer can disburse approved loan', async () => {
    // Similar to admin test
  });
  
  test('client cannot disburse loan', async () => {
    // Setup: Client session
    // Action: Attempt perform_disbursement
    // Assert: Error 'Unauthorized'
  });
  
  test('cannot disburse already disbursed loan', async () => {
    // Setup: Disbursed loan
    // Action: Attempt second disbursement
    // Assert: Error 'already disbursed'
  });
  
  test('disbursement creates audit trail', async () => {
    // Setup: Approved loan
    // Action: Disburse
    // Assert: audit_logs entry exists
  });
});
```

#### UI Tests (`e2e/backoffice-disbursement.e2e.ts`)
```typescript
describe('Backoffice Disbursement UI', () => {
  test('Disburse button visible for approved loans', async () => {
    // Navigate to Loan Management
    // Assert: "Disburse" button present for approved loan
  });
  
  test('Disbursement modal flow', async () => {
    // Click "Disburse"
    // Fill method, reference
    // Submit
    // Assert: Success message, loan status updated
  });
  
  test('Repayments visible after disbursement', async () => {
    // Disburse loan
    // Navigate to loan details
    // Assert: Repayment schedule visible
  });
});
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All API tests pass
- [ ] All UI tests pass
- [ ] RLS enforcement verified
- [ ] Audit trail verified
- [ ] E2E flow: approve â†’ disburse â†’ repayments works

|------|--------|-----------|
| RLS policy gaps | High | Comprehensive test suite |
| Type drift | Medium | CI checks on schema changes |
| Disbursement errors | High | Thorough validation, audit trail, rollback capability |
| Missing audit trail | High | Automated tests verify audit logs |

---

## Next Actions

   - Add RLS tests for documents and disbursements
   - Generate and adopt unified Supabase types

2. **Critical (Week 3):**
   - Implement backoffice disbursement UI
