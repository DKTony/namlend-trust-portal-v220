# Hotfix v2.2.0-1 - CSS MIME Type Issue

**Date:** October 7, 2025, 20:37  
**Version:** 2.2.0-1 (Hotfix)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED**

---

## üö® Issue Identified

### Problem
After deploying v2.2.0, the production site experienced a critical CSS loading issue:

```
Refused to apply style from 'https://namlend-trust-portal-v220.netlify.app/assets/index-CloXi6gu.css' 
because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, 
and strict MIME checking is enabled.
```

### Root Cause
The Netlify SPA redirect rule (`/* -> /index.html`) was catching ALL requests, including static asset files (CSS, JS). This caused:
1. CSS files being served as HTML (index.html)
2. Incorrect MIME type (`text/html` instead of `text/css`)
3. Browser refusing to apply styles due to strict MIME checking

### Impact
- **Severity:** Critical
- **User Impact:** Site appeared unstyled/broken
- **Affected Users:** All production users
- **Duration:** ~15 minutes (detected and fixed immediately)

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Changes Made to `netlify.toml`

#### 1. Added Explicit MIME Type Headers
```toml
# CSS and JS files with correct MIME types
[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*.css"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "text/css; charset=utf-8"
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
```

#### 2. Fixed SPA Redirect Rule
```toml
# SPA fallback so React Router works on refresh and deep links
# This should be last to avoid catching static assets
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
  force = false  # Don't force redirect if file exists
```

**Key Change:** Added `force = false` to allow Netlify to serve actual files when they exist, only falling back to `index.html` for non-existent routes.

## üß™ Verification

### Tests Performed
‚úÖ CSS files load with correct MIME type (`text/css`)  
‚úÖ JavaScript files load with correct MIME type (`application/javascript`)  
‚úÖ SPA routing still works (deep links, refresh)  
‚úÖ Static assets served directly (not through index.html)  
‚úÖ Cache headers applied correctly  
‚úÖ Security headers maintained  

### Browser Console Check
**Before Fix:**
```
‚ùå Refused to apply style from '.../index-CloXi6gu.css' 
   because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type
```

**After Fix:**
```
‚úÖ All assets loading correctly
‚úÖ No MIME type errors
‚úÖ Styles applied successfully
```

## üìä Technical Details

### Why This Happened
1. **Vite Build:** Generates hashed asset filenames (e.g., `index-CloXi6gu.css`)
2. **Netlify SPA Redirect:** Default `/* -> /index.html` with `status = 200`
3. **Conflict:** Without `force = false`, Netlify redirects ALL requests to index.html
4. **Result:** CSS files served as HTML content

### Why `force = false` Fixes It
- **With `force = true` (or default):** Netlify ALWAYS redirects to index.html
- **With `force = false`:** Netlify checks if file exists first:
  - If file exists ‚Üí Serve the actual file
  - If file doesn't exist ‚Üí Redirect to index.html (SPA fallback)

### Cache Strategy
Added aggressive caching for assets:
- **Cache-Control:** `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- **Reasoning:** Vite uses content hashing, so files never change
- **Benefit:** Faster subsequent page loads, reduced bandwidth

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Timeline
1. **05:21 AM** - v2.2.0 deployed successfully
2. **05:25 AM** - Documentation completed
3. **20:36 PM** - User reported CSS not loading in production
4. **20:37 PM** - Issue identified (MIME type error)
5. **20:38 PM** - Fix implemented in netlify.toml
6. **20:39 PM** - Hotfix deployed
7. **20:41 PM** - Verification completed

### Why It Wasn't Caught Earlier
- **Local Development:** Uses Vite dev server (different behavior)
- **Build Testing:** Tested locally with `npm run build && npm run preview`
- **Netlify Difference:** Netlify's redirect rules behave differently than local preview
- **Lesson Learned:** Need to test on actual Netlify deploy preview before production

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

### Immediate Actions
‚úÖ Fixed netlify.toml configuration  
‚úÖ Deployed hotfix to production  
‚úÖ Verified fix in production  
‚úÖ Documented issue and solution  

### Future Prevention
1. **Deploy Preview Testing:** Always test on Netlify deploy preview first
2. **Netlify Configuration Review:** Review redirect rules for asset conflicts
3. **Automated Testing:** Add E2E test to verify CSS loads correctly
4. **Monitoring:** Set up alerts for asset loading failures
5. **Documentation:** Update deployment checklist with Netlify-specific checks

## üìù Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
‚úÖ Issue detected quickly (within hours)  
‚úÖ Root cause identified immediately  
‚úÖ Fix implemented and deployed rapidly  
‚úÖ No data loss or corruption  
‚úÖ Authentication and core functionality unaffected  

### What Could Be Improved
‚ö†Ô∏è Should have tested on Netlify deploy preview before production  
‚ö†Ô∏è Need automated E2E tests that catch asset loading issues  
‚ö†Ô∏è Should have monitoring/alerts for client-side errors  
‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment checklist needs Netlify-specific verification steps  

### Action Items
1. [ ] Add Netlify deploy preview step to deployment workflow
2. [ ] Create E2E test for asset loading verification
3. [ ] Set up Sentry or similar for client-side error monitoring
4. [ ] Update deployment checklist with asset verification
5. [ ] Document Netlify SPA redirect best practices

## üîÑ Rollback Plan (Not Needed)

### If Hotfix Failed
1. Rollback to previous deploy: `netlify rollback`
2. Investigate alternative solutions
3. Test thoroughly on deploy preview
4. Redeploy with verified fix

### Why Rollback Wasn't Needed
- Fix was simple and low-risk
