---

## Executive Summary

The NamLend backoffice loan management system has been successfully analyzed, documented, and enabled for full operational use. Critical bugs have been fixed, functionality has been verified, and comprehensive documentation has been created.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### ðŸš¨ Priority Value Bug Fixed

**Issue:** `submitApprovalRequest()` was setting invalid priority value `'medium'`
**Location:** `src/services/approvalWorkflow.ts` line 75
**Fix Applied:**

```typescript
// Changed from:
priority: requestData.priority || 'medium'
// To:
priority: requestData.priority || 'normal'
```

**Impact:** Prevents database constraint violations when submitting loan applications

### ðŸš¨ Schema Mismatch Fixed

**Issue:** `processApprovedLoanApplication()` trying to insert non-existent `approved_at` column
**Location:** `src/services/approvalWorkflow.ts` line 444
**Fix Applied:**

```typescript
// Changed from:
approved_at: new Date().toISOString(),
// To:
disbursed_at: new Date().toISOString() // Use existing column
```

**Impact:** Ensures loan records are created successfully when applications are approved
