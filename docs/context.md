## Completed Enhancements (v2.3.x) ✅

- **Goal**: Improve data fidelity, UX responsiveness, and live updates while preserving RLS and 32% APR compliance.
- **Status**: All phases completed and deployed to production (Oct 8-9, 2025)
- **Reference**: See `docs/ENHANCEMENT_PLAN_v2.3.x.md` for details

## Completed Enhancements (v2.4.x) ✅

- **Goal**: Enterprise workflow engine, comprehensive audit trails, and mobile native app
- **Status**: All phases completed (Oct 9, 2025) - Architecture ready, implementation pending
- **Reference**: See `docs/ENHANCEMENT_PLAN_v2.4.x.md` for the full plan (objectives, phases, acceptance criteria)

### Phase 1 (v2.3.0): UX & Data Quality
- Pull employment status from `profiles` into pending and loan views; surface in `LoanDetailsModal` and list badges.
- Add skeleton loaders for `LoanApplicationsList` and ensure `PaymentOverview` loading indicators.
- Better error states with Retry for Loans/Payments.
- Enhance filtering: date range (created_at), amount range (NAD), priority (approvals).

### Phase 2 (v2.3.1): Unified Data Model
- Create RLS‑safe SQL view `loan_applications_unified` joining approvals + loans with normalized columns.
- Refactor `useLoanApplications()` to read the unified view; keep feature‑flag fallback.

### Phase 3 (v2.3.2): Realtime Updates
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions for `approval_requests` and `payments` with throttled auto‑refresh and toast notification.
- Live payment status updates and pending queue refresh within 3s.

## 2) Chat Context Summary (for agent continuity)

- **Time window:** Mission-Critical System Remediation and Enterprise Enhancement (September 2025)
- **Key activities:**
  - **User Management Dashboard:** Fixed TypeScript errors, import issues, and runtime errors in UserManagementDashboard.tsx
  - **User Authentication:** Created admin user (<anthnydklrk@gmail.com>) and client user (<client@namlend.com>) with proper role assignments
  - **Production Configuration:** Disabled development scripts by setting VITE_RUN_DEV_SCRIPTS=false for clean production deployment
  - **User Interface Updates:** Added UserAnalytics, UserActivityMonitor, and UserImportWizard components to admin dashboard
  - **Data Model Fixes:** Updated User interface in useUsersList hook to include permissions, isVerified, loginCount, and department fields
  - **System Remediation:** Completed comprehensive resolution of loan workflow and user management defects
  - **Enterprise Enhancements:** Implemented error handling, monitoring, testing, and documentation systems
- **Decisions made:**
  - Use approval workflow system (approval_requests table) for loan application submissions instead of direct loans table insertion
  - Implement processApprovedLoanApplication function to move approved requests to loans table
  - Maintain separation between development and production environments with environment flags
  - Use mock data in user management components until real Supabase integration is completed
- **System Status (Sep 24, 2025 verification):**
  - ❌ Loan applications blocked at submission because approval workflow tables/RPCs absent in production
  - ❌ RPC functions for approval processing pending re-deployment
  - ⚠️ Client dashboard still renders historical data but lacks new submissions
  - ✅ Admin dashboard remains connected to live user management data (profiles, roles, error logs)

## 4) Interfaces & Contracts (ultra-condensed)

### APIs

- **Supabase REST** → `/rest/v1/*`, JWT auth, RLS-protected CRUD operations
- **Approval Workflow** → `approvalWorkflow.ts` service, submit/fetch/update/process functions
- **Auth** → Supabase Auth, email/password, role-based access (admin/client)

### Data Models

- **approval_requests** → id, user_id, request_type, status, metadata, created_at
- **approval_workflow_history** → request_id, old_status, new_status, admin_notes, timestamp
- **approval_notifications** → id, admin_id, request_id, message, read_at, created_at
- **profiles** → user_id, role, full_name, email, phone, created_at
- **loans** → id, user_id, amount, status, interest_rate, term_months

### Events/Queues

- **Approval Status Changes** → Database triggers → Notification creation
- **Real-time Updates** → Supabase Realtime → Admin dashboard notifications

### External Dependencies

- **Supabase** → Backend-as-a-Service, PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime + Storage
- **Tailwind CSS** → Utility-first styling framework
- **shadcn/ui** → React component library with Radix UI primitives

## 5) Risks & Constraints

### Security

- Mandatory approval workflow for regulatory compliance

### Performance

- Real-time notifications may impact database performance at scale
- Approval workflow adds latency to user request processing

### Technical Constraints

- React 18.3.1, TypeScript, Supabase stack locked
- NAD currency only, Namibian market focus
- Development utilities gated behind environment flags

## 6) Glossary & Acronyms
