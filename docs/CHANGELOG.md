- Environment: `.env` with `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## [2.3.2] - 2025-10-06

### Added

- Assign Role modal verified end-to-end on Admin → User Management → Roles.
  - Search powered by `public.get_profiles_with_roles_admin(...)` (SECURITY DEFINER) with staff guard.
  - Role assignment path: Edge Function `admin-assign-role` with RPC fallback to `assign_user_role`.
- Playwright E2E: `e2e/assign-role-modal.spec.ts` for modal open/close verification and smoke login.
- k6 script for Edge Function load testing: `scripts/k6/admin-assign-role-load.js` with ENV usage docs.

### Changed

- Recreated `public.profiles_with_roles` view to expose aggregated `roles app_role[]`, `primary_role`, and convenience flags; aligned with admin search needs.
- Enhanced `public.get_profiles_with_roles_admin(p_search_term, p_role_filter, p_limit, p_offset)`:
  - Qualified columns to avoid ambiguity with OUT params.
  - Added `left join auth.users` and `coalesce(pwr.email, u.email)` for robust email display.
  - Search now matches first/last/email/phone and `user_id::text`.
- UI copy alignment retained for payments: “Debit Order (Card)” in `src/components/PaymentModal.tsx`.

### Security & RLS

- Dropped legacy zero‑arg `get_profiles_with_roles_admin()` overload to prevent RPC confusion.
- Kept SECURITY DEFINER with staff guard and pinned search_path; `EXECUTE` restricted to `authenticated`.
- Role assignment continues to use server-only paths (Edge Function or SECURITY DEFINER) to avoid client exposure.

### Deployment

- Applied DB changes directly to production via Supabase MCP due to local CLI linking constraints.
- Deployment guide updated with an MCP-based alternative workflow.

### Testing

- Verified Assign Role modal search and assignment in a live session using mcp‑playwright.
- Provided Playwright and k6 run instructions (env-driven, headful supported).

## [2.3.1] - 2025-10-05

### Added

- Admin Role Management wiring:
  - `src/pages/AdminDashboard/components/UserManagement/RoleManagement.tsx` now assigns roles via `serviceRoleAssignment.assignRoleWithServiceRole()` (Edge Function).
  - RPC fallback to `assign_user_role` (SECURITY DEFINER) if Edge Function unavailable.
  - Role counts sourced via `adminService.getProfilesWithRoles()`.
- Payments write flows:
  - `src/components/PaymentModal.tsx` uses `paymentService.recordPayment()` with normalized methods (bank→bank_transfer, mobile→mobile_money, card→debit_order, agent→cash).
  - `src/pages/AdminDashboard/components/PaymentManagement/PaymentsList.tsx` Retry triggers `recordPayment()` with `RETRY-` reference prefix.

### Documentation

- `docs/technical-specs/README.md` bumped to v2.3.1 with addendum describing Role Management and Payment updates.
- `docs/technical-specs/backoffice-technical-spec.md` §5.6 updated to include Role Management mapping.
- `docs/technical-specs/backoffice-traceability.md` updated with PAY-003, PAY-004, ADMIN-003.

### Security & RLS

- No RLS changes. Role writes executed via Edge Function/SECURITY DEFINER fallback; reads remain under authenticated policies.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-10-05

### Added

- Backoffice Technical Specification (TSD) expansion:
  - APPR APIs detailed with request/response schemas and RLS notes
  - New module API contracts documented: LOAN, PAY, CLIENT, ADMIN
  - RLS documentation added for: `loans`, `payments`, `disbursements`, `profiles`, `user_roles`
- New Backoffice Traceability Matrix document:
  - `docs/technical-specs/backoffice-traceability.md` maps FSD → UI → Services → DB/View/RPC
  - Status flags for coverage and follow-ups
- Service stubs to ensure docs↔code parity (no breaking changes):
  - `src/services/loanService.ts` — `getLoanById`, `updateLoanStatus`, `createDisbursement`
  - `src/services/paymentService.ts` — `listPayments`, `recordPayment`
  - `src/services/clientService.ts` — `getProfile`, `updateProfile` (live columns only)
  - `src/services/adminService.ts` — `getProfilesWithRoles` (RPC), `listUserRoles`
- Cross-references:
  - Linked Backoffice TSD from `docs/technical-specs/README.md`
  - Added new docs to `docs/INDEX.md`
  - UI wiring documented in TSD §5.6 (hooks → services)

### Changed

- Documentation consistency and cross-linking improvements across technical specs.
- Minor formatting refinements; remaining markdown lint cleanups scheduled.

### Security & Runtime Impact

- Docs-only release. No runtime logic changes. Existing RLS and authentication flows preserved.

## [2.2.5] - 2025-10-01

### Added

- Security hardening across database layer:
  - Views set to SECURITY INVOKER with anon/public revoked; authenticated-only read where applicable:
    - `public.profiles_with_roles`, `public.client_portfolio`, `public.financial_summary`, `public.approval_requests_expanded`
  - Function hardening: pinned `search_path` inside bodies with `PERFORM set_config('search_path','public',true);` and via `ALTER FUNCTION` for:
    - `increment_version()`, `check_loan_eligibility()`, `check_loan_eligibility_admin(uuid)`, `get_dashboard_summary()`
  - RLS consolidation using `(SELECT auth.uid())` and role checks via `public.user_roles` on:
    - `profiles`, `user_roles`, `kyc_documents`, `loans`, `payments`, `approval_requests`, `approval_workflow_history`, `approval_workflow_rules`, `approval_notifications`, `notifications`, `disbursements`, `error_logs`
- Playwright E2E additions and hardening:
  - `e2e/admin-approvals-actions.e2e.ts` (non‑mutating approvals checks; verifies no write requests)
  - `e2e/admin-currency.e2e.ts` (N$ currency enforcement; skips gracefully if admin UI unavailable)

- Notifications system reinstated (bell UI + DB triggers):
  - UI:
    - `src/components/Header.tsx`: `NotificationBell` visible for all authenticated users (front office).
    - `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`: `NotificationBell` added to admin top header (back office).
  - Database triggers emitting `public.approval_notifications`:
    - `notify_approval_request_created` on `public.approval_requests` INSERT → notifies admins/loan officers of new submissions (back office).
    - `notify_approval_status_change` on `public.approval_requests` UPDATE → notifies the client on status changes (approved/rejected/under_review) (front office).
    - `notify_payment_events` on `public.payments` INSERT/UPDATE → notifies back office on new payments; notifies client when payment status changes (processed/failed) (front + back office).
    - `notify_profile_update` on `public.profiles` UPDATE → notifies back office when clients update profile details (back office).

### Changed

- Consolidated multiple permissive RLS policies per table/action into single efficient policies to reduce evaluation overhead.
- Added covering indexes for advisor-flagged foreign keys across approvals, disbursements, loan reviews, notifications, payments.

### Security & Compliance

- OTP expiry reduced to ≤ 1 hour (e.g., 1200s) in Supabase Auth Email provider.
- Leaked password protection (HIBP) pending/plan-dependent; advisor may continue to warn until enabled.

### Advisor Status

- Security: views/RPC/function search_path warnings cleared; remaining advisories: HIBP (pending) and Postgres minor upgrade available.
- Performance: auth_rls_initplan and multiple-permissive-policy warnings resolved for consolidated tables; remaining notices are informational `unused_index` candidates.

## [2.2.4] - 2025-09-28

### Added

- Centralized currency formatting utility:
  - `src/utils/currency.ts` with `formatNAD` and `nadFormatter` for NAD (en-NA) formatting
  - Replaced scattered `Intl.NumberFormat` usages across Dashboard, Payment, PaymentModal, LoanApplication, ClientProfileDashboard, PaymentOverview, DisbursementManager, ApprovalManagementDashboard
- Reactive Admin refresh (no hard reload):
  - `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` uses `refreshKey` to remount tab content and refetch metrics
- Database migration: `supabase/migrations/20250928_admin_metrics_disbursements.sql`
  - `public.disbursements` ledger with RLS (client reads own; admin/loan_officer insert/update/read)
  - Triggers: propagate `status='disbursed'` to `loans` and set `disbursed_at`
  - RPC `public.get_admin_dashboard_summary()` (SECURITY DEFINER) with in-function role check
  - Performance indexes on `loans`, `payments`, `approval_requests`
- Tests (Playwright):
  - `e2e/api/admin-rpc.e2e.ts` validates admin metrics RPC
  - `e2e/api/disbursements-ledger.e2e.ts` validates ledger read
  - `e2e/api/disbursements-ledger-crud.e2e.ts` validates insert→complete propagation
  - `e2e/unit/currency-util.e2e.ts` validates `formatNAD`

### Changed

- `usePaymentMetrics` enhanced to expose `overdueCount`; aligned `PaymentOverview` usage
- Removed hard `window.location.reload()` patterns from admin in favor of reactive refresh

### Security & Compliance

- Maintained RLS on new `disbursements` table; admin RPC guarded by `user_roles` check
- Preserved NAD currency and 32% APR messaging compliance (no changes to APR logic)

### Verification

- Migration applied to production project (eu-north-1) and verified via system catalogs and indexes
- RPC presence confirmed; API tests require configured credentials to execute end‑to‑end

## [2.2.3] - 2025-09-27

### UI/UX & Compliance

- Performed responsive design audit on public routes (`/`, `/auth`) across common mobile and tablet viewports.
- Verified no horizontal overflow including when mobile navigation is open; captured screenshots and measurements via Puppeteer.
- Updated APR messaging to comply with the 32% cap:
  - `src/components/HeroSection.tsx`: “Representative APR: up to 32% p.a.”
  - `src/components/Footer.tsx`: “Representative APR: up to 32% p.a.”
- Improved mobile accessibility and tap targets (44px+) in `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx`; added ARIA and focus ring where applicable.
- Tailwind: refined container padding for small screens in `tailwind.config.ts`; preserved existing breakpoints and theme extensions.

### Testing

- Manual Puppeteer-based viewport checks executed at 320×640, 375×667, 390×844, 414×896, 640×360, 768×1024, 1024×768.
- Result: No horizontal overflow detected on tested pages.
- Next: add CI task to automate viewport screenshots and overflow checks; extend coverage to `/dashboard` and `/admin` after auth.

### Documentation

#### RESOLVED: Payments Table Schema Mismatch

- **Issue**: `column payments.user_id does not exist` error in dashboard data fetch
- **Root Cause**: Dashboard code querying payments table with non-existent `user_id` column
- **Database Schema**: Payments table uses `loan_id` to reference loans, not direct `user_id`
- **Solution**: Updated query to join through loans table relationship
- **Impact**: Dashboard payments section now loads without errors

#### TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

- **Query Fix**: Changed from `eq('user_id', user?.id)` to `eq('loans.user_id', user?.id)` with proper join
- **Schema Alignment**: Updated Payment interface to reflect actual database structure
- **Join Strategy**: Used `loans!inner(user_id)` to properly access user's payments through loan relationship

- **Input Validation**: Enhanced email validation and normalization

### Technical Details

```typescript
// Service role key configuration
const serviceRoleKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY;
export const supabaseAdmin = createClient(supabaseUrl, serviceRoleKey, {
  auth: { autoRefreshToken: false, persistSession: false }
});
```

### Known Issues

- Service role key validation may require verification in Supabase Dashboard
- Manual password reset via Dashboard may be needed if service key is outdated

## [1.3.2] - 2025-08-09

### Fixed

- Authentication form: resolved email input concatenation in `src/pages/Auth.tsx` by clearing default values and setting appropriate input attributes (`autoComplete`, `inputMode`).
- Sample data utility: removed RLS-violating loan for a foreign `user_id`; all sample loans now bind to the authenticated `user.id` in `src/utils/createSampleLoans.ts`.
- Logging: success message now reflects dynamic sample count instead of hardcoded value.

### Changed

- Documentation synced (Technical Specs version bump, Executive Summary notes, Test Plan additions for auth form and RLS compliance).

### Verification

- Sign in via `/auth` and ensure email entry no longer concatenates.
- Run sample loan creation (dev scripts enabled) and confirm no RLS violations and correct success count.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-08-08

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Sign-out flow: `useAuth.signOut()` now clears local state (`user`, `session`, `userRole`) after `supabase.auth.signOut()` instead of forcing a hard page reload. Prevents reload loops and ensures immediate UI update.
- Sign-out button in Header component now works correctly with React Router navigation instead of hard page reloads.

### Added

- `src/utils/testSignOut.ts` - Comprehensive test utility for verifying sign-out functionality and auth state management.
- Sign-out test utilities available globally as `window.__TEST_SIGN_OUT__` for debugging.

### Changed

- Gated auto-running development scripts in `src/main.tsx` behind `VITE_RUN_DEV_SCRIPTS` flag to avoid interfering with authentication flows (e.g., auto role setup, test data creation, and page reloads).
- Added console notice when dev auto-scripts are disabled.

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Before: Hard reload causing issues
const signOut = async () => {
  try {
    await supabase.auth.signOut({ scope: 'global' });
    window.location.href = '/'; // ❌ Hard reload
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Sign out error:', error);
  }
};

// After: Smooth state management
const signOut = async () => {
  try {
    await supabase.auth.signOut({ scope: 'global' });
    // Clear local auth state so UI updates immediately without hard reload
    setUser(null);
    setSession(null);
    setUserRole(null);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Sign out error:', error);
  }
};
```

### Testing

- ✅ Sign-out API call works correctly
- ✅ Local auth state is properly cleared
- ✅ UI updates immediately without page reload
- ✅ React Router navigation handles redirect smoothly
- ✅ No interference from background dev utilities

### Notes

- To enable the dev utilities locally, set `VITE_RUN_DEV_SCRIPTS=true` in your environment (e.g., `.env.local`) and refresh.
- With scripts disabled (default), sign-in/out flows are stable and not impacted by background test utilities.
- Sign-out button is now fully responsive and completes the authentication flow successfully.

const fetchUserRole = useCallback(async (userId: string) => {
  // Immediate fallback for known admin users
  if (userId === 'known-admin-id') {
    setUserRole('admin');
    return 'admin';
  }
  
  // Attempt database query with timeout and error handling
  try {
    const result = await Promise.race([queryPromise, timeoutPromise]);
    // Handle result...
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to known user handling
  }
}, []);
```

**React Component Stability:**

```typescript
// Before: Hooks called conditionally causing violations
const AdminDashboard = () => {
  if (loading) return <Loading />; // ❌ Early return before hooks
  const { user } = useAuth(); // ❌ Hook called after conditional return
  
// After: All hooks called unconditionally
const AdminDashboard = () => {
  const { user, isAdmin } = useAuth(); // ✅ All hooks first
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true); // ✅ All state hooks
  
  // All function definitions here...
  
  // Conditional returns only after all hooks
  if (loading) return <Loading />; // ✅ Safe conditional return
