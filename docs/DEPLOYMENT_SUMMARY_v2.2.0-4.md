## üîß Technical Details

### Database Queries Optimized

#### Before (RPC-dependent):
```typescript
const { data: rpcData } = await supabase.rpc('get_admin_dashboard_summary');
```

#### After (Direct queries):
```typescript
const [clientsResult, loansResult, paymentsResult, overdueResult] = await Promise.all([
  supabase.from('profiles').select('id', { count: 'exact', head: true }),
  supabase.from('loans').select('amount, status'),
  supabase.from('payments').select('amount').eq('status', 'completed'),
  supabase.from('payments').select('id', { count: 'exact', head: true }).eq('status', 'overdue')
]);
```

**Benefits:**
- More reliable (no RPC dependency)
- Better error handling
- Easier debugging
- Direct data access

### Modal Integration Pattern

```typescript
// State management
const [selectedLoanId, setSelectedLoanId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [loanDetailsOpen, setLoanDetailsOpen] = useState(false);

// Open modal
const handleReview = (loanId: string) => {
  setSelectedLoanId(loanId);
  setLoanDetailsOpen(true);
};

// Data transformation
const getSelectedLoanForModal = () => {
  const application = applications.find(app => app.id === selectedLoanId);
  return transformToModalFormat(application);
};

// Modal component
<LoanDetailsModal
  open={loanDetailsOpen}
  onClose={() => {
    setLoanDetailsOpen(false);
    setSelectedLoanId(null);
  }}
  loan={getSelectedLoanForModal()}
/>
```
