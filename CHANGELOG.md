# Changelog - NamLend Trust Platform

All notable changes to the NamLend Trust Platform will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.7.1] - 2025-10-18 (Mobile Phase 3: Schema Alignment & Payments)

### Added

- **Mobile Payments UX**
  - Submit Payment button on `PaymentScreenEnhanced.tsx` with in-flight state.
  - Bank Transfer path now captures `reference_number` via input field.

### Changed

- **Loans List & Details**
  - Active tab now includes both `active` and `disbursed` statuses.
  - Added "Approved" filter tab in `LoansListScreen.tsx`.
  - `LoanDetailsScreen.tsx` shows Make Payment button for `active` and `disbursed` loans.

- **Navigation Types**
  - Typed navigation for `LoansListScreen.tsx`, `LoanDetailsScreen.tsx`, and `ProfileScreen.tsx`.
  - Removed `as never`/`@ts-ignore` casts; uses `NativeStackNavigationProp` and `BottomTabNavigationProp`.

### Fixed

- **Schema Alignment (Supabase)**
  - Replaced non-existent `payment_date` with `paid_at` across services and screens.
  - Removed non-existent `loans.outstanding_balance` and `next_payment_date`; now use `total_repayment` and `disbursed_at`.
  - `payments.user_id` does not exist:
    - Removed from inserts in `paymentService.ts` and `offlineProcessor.ts`.
    - `getMyPayments()` now filters via `loans!inner(user_id)` join and strips the joined object.

- **Type Safety**
  - `paymentService.ts` reducers/maps typed with numeric normalization for `totalPaid`, `pendingPayments`, `lastPaymentDate`.

### Notes

- **Schema Notes**
  - `payments`: use `paid_at` timestamp; no `user_id` column.
  - `loans`: use `total_repayment`, `disbursed_at`; statuses include `approved`, `active`, `disbursed`, `completed`.

- **QA**
  - Verified end-to-end: Loan application amount prefill → Disbursed loan → Make Payment keypad → Submit → Payment history ordered by `paid_at`.
