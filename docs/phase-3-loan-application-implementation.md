# Phase 3: New Loan Application Flow Implementation

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented complete loan application flow for mobile with multi-step form, validation, APR compliance (≤32%), NAD currency formatting, and offline queue support. The implementation mirrors web functionality while providing native mobile UX patterns.

**Key Achievement:** Mobile users can now apply for loans with the same validation and compliance as the web platform.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

#### 1. `LoanApplicationStartScreen.tsx` ✅
**Purpose:** Entry point for loan applications with eligibility check and terms agreement

**Features:**
- Eligibility requirements checklist
- Loan features overview (amounts, terms, rates)
- APR disclosure banner: "Representative APR: up to 32% p.a."
- Terms and conditions agreement checkbox
- Navigation to application form

**Key Components:**
- NAD currency formatting via `formatNAD()` utility
- MAX_APR from environment variable (`EXPO_PUBLIC_MAX_APR`)
- Lucide icons for visual consistency
- Responsive card-based layout

#### 2. `LoanApplicationFormScreen.tsx` ✅
**Purpose:** Multi-step loan application form with validation and submission

**Features:**
- **Step 1: Loan Details**
  - Amount input (NAD 1,000 - NAD 50,000)
  - Term input (3-36 months)
  - Purpose textarea (10-500 characters)
  - Real-time loan calculation preview
  - APR notice: "Representative APR: up to 32% p.a."

- **Step 2: Financial Information**
  - Employment status picker
  - Monthly income (minimum NAD 2,000)
  - Monthly expenses (must be < income)
  - Existing debt (optional)

- **Step 3: Review & Submit**
  - Complete application summary
  - Repayment details with highlighted monthly payment
  - Final confirmation notice
  - Submit with loading state

**Validation Rules:**
- Amount: NAD 1,000 - NAD 50,000
- Term: 3-36 months
- Purpose: 10-500 characters
- Employment status: Required
- Monthly income: ≥ NAD 2,000
- Monthly expenses: < Monthly income

**Loan Calculation:**
```typescript
const monthlyRate = MAX_APR / 100 / 12;
const monthlyPayment = (principal * monthlyRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, term)) / 
                       (Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, term) - 1);
const totalRepayment = monthlyPayment * term;
```

**Error Handling:**
- Field-level validation with error messages
- Network failure → offline queue
- User-friendly error alerts
- Graceful fallback to offline mode

### Files Modified

#### 3. `ClientStack.tsx` ✅
**Changes:**
- Added `LoanApplicationStartScreen` import
- Added `LoanApplicationFormScreen` import
- Updated `ClientStackParamList` type with new routes
- Added screens to `LoansStack` navigator

**Navigation Flow:**
```
LoansTab → LoansList → LoanApplicationStart → LoanApplicationForm → DashboardTab
```

#### 4. `loanService.ts` ✅
**Added Method:** `submitLoanApplication(userId, applicationData)`

**Implementation:**
- Submits to `approval_requests` table
- Request type: `'loan_application'`
- Status: `'pending'`
- Priority: `'normal'`
- Returns: `{ success: boolean; error?: string; data?: any }`

**Integration:**
- Works with existing approval workflow
- Preserves RLS policies
- Proper error handling and logging

#### 5. `offlineQueue.ts` ✅
**Changes:**
- Added `'loan_application'` to `OfflineOpType`
- Enables offline submission queueing
- Auto-sync when connection restored

---

## Compliance & Standards

### APR Compliance ✅
- **Messaging:** "Representative APR: up to 32% p.a." displayed prominently
- **Calculation:** Uses MAX_APR from `EXPO_PUBLIC_MAX_APR` environment variable
- **Validation:** Interest rate capped at 32% per annum
- **Consistency:** Matches web platform messaging

### NAD Currency Formatting ✅
- **Utility:** `formatNAD()` from `src/utils/currency.ts`
- **Usage:** All currency displays (amounts, payments, totals)
- **Format:** "N$ 5,000.00" with proper thousands separators

### Security ✅
- **Authentication:** User ID from authenticated session
- **RLS:** Submission respects Row-Level Security policies
- **Validation:** Server-side validation via approval workflow
- **No Hardcoding:** No sensitive data or keys in code

## User Experience

### Multi-Step Progress
- Visual progress bar (0% → 33% → 67% → 100%)
- Step indicators (Step 1 of 3, Step 2 of 3, Step 3 of 3)
- Back navigation at each step
- Clear section titles and descriptions

### Real-Time Feedback
- Loan calculation updates as user types
- Field-level validation errors
- Helper text for input requirements
- Loading states during submission

### Offline Support
- Failed submissions queued automatically
- User notified of offline mode
- Auto-sync when connection restored
- No data loss

### Accessibility
- Large touch targets (minimum 44x44 points)
- Clear labels and helper text
- Error messages with context
- Keyboard-friendly inputs

## Testing Scenarios

### Happy Path ✅
1. User opens loan application from dashboard
2. Reviews eligibility and agrees to terms
3. Enters loan amount (e.g., NAD 10,000) and term (12 months)
4. Sees calculated monthly payment and total repayment
5. Enters financial information
6. Reviews application summary
7. Submits successfully
8. Receives confirmation and returns to dashboard

### Validation Scenarios ✅
- Amount too low (< NAD 1,000) → Error message
- Amount too high (> NAD 50,000) → Error message
- Term too short (< 3 months) → Error message
- Term too long (> 36 months) → Error message
- Purpose too short (< 10 characters) → Error message
- Income too low (< NAD 2,000) → Error message
- Expenses ≥ Income → Error message

### Offline Scenario ✅
1. User fills out application
2. Network connection lost
3. User submits application
4. Application queued for offline submission
5. User notified: "Queued for Submission"
6. Connection restored
7. Offline processor auto-submits
8. User receives approval notification

### Error Scenarios ✅
- Authentication expired → "Please sign in again"
- Network timeout → Offline queue
- Server error → User-friendly error message
- Invalid data → Field-level validation errors
