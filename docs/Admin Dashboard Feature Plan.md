  action_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_id UUID,
  details JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- System configuration
CREATE TABLE system_settings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  setting_key TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  setting_value JSONB NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  updated_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Notification tracking
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,

```

#### Enhanced Views

```sql
-- Loan performance analytics
CREATE VIEW loan_performance_summary AS
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
  COUNT(*) as total_applications,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'approved' THEN 1 END) as approved_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'rejected' THEN 1 END) as rejected_count,
  AVG(amount) as average_loan_amount,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as total_disbursed
FROM loans
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at)
ORDER BY month DESC;
```
