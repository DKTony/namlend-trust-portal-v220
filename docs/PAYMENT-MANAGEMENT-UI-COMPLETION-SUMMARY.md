## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Type Safety
- All components use TypeScript with proper interfaces
- Service function return types properly handled
- Props interfaces defined for all components
- No `any` types used (except for necessary JSON parsing)

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks in all async operations
- User-friendly error messages via toast notifications
- Loading states prevent duplicate submissions
- Validation before API calls
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

### UI/UX Patterns
- Consistent use of shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS for styling (matching existing patterns)
- Lucide icons throughout
- Loading skeletons for async operations
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Color coding for status indicators

### Currency Formatting
- All amounts use `formatNAD()` utility
- Consistent NAD currency display
- Proper decimal handling (2 places)

### Date Formatting
- Consistent date format: `en-NA` locale
- Format: "Oct 7, 2025" (short month, day, year)
- Used throughout all components

## 🔗 Service Integration

All components integrate with production-ready services:

### Disbursement Services
```typescript
import {
  approveDisbursement,
  markDisbursementProcessing,
  completeDisbursement,
  failDisbursement,
  getPendingDisbursements
} from '@/services/disbursementService';
```

### Payment Services
```typescript
import {
  getPaymentSchedule,
  generatePaymentSchedule
} from '@/services/paymentService';
```

### Collections Services
```typescript
import {
  generateCollectionQueue,
  recordCollectionActivity,
  getCollectionActivities
} from '@/services/collectionsService';
```
