# Enhancement Plan â€” v2.4.x

Version: Draft v1 â€¢ Date: 2025-10-09 â€¢ Owner: Engineering â€¢ Status: ðŸŽ¯ Planning

## Executive Summary

The v2.4.x enhancement plan focuses on three strategic pillars:
1. **Workflow Engine** - Configurable multi-level approval chains
2. **Audit Trail Enhancement** - Comprehensive compliance and view tracking
3. **Mobile Native App** - React Native interface for clients and approvers

This represents a significant architectural evolution from static approval logic to dynamic, configurable workflows with enterprise-grade auditing and mobile-first client experience.

---

## Objectives

### Business Objectives
- **Flexibility**: Configure approval workflows without code changes
- **Compliance**: Meet Namibian regulatory audit requirements
- **Accessibility**: Enable clients to manage loans from mobile devices
- **Transparency**: Track every action and view for accountability

### Technical Objectives
- Decouple approval logic from application code
- Build reusable workflow engine for future use cases
- Implement comprehensive audit logging
- Create performant mobile-first React Native app
- Maintain RLS security and 32% APR compliance

## Phase 1 (v2.4.0) â€” Workflow Engine Foundation

### Scope

Build the foundational workflow engine infrastructure:
- Database schema for workflow definitions
- State machine implementation
- Multi-level approval chain execution
- Configurable approval stages

### Database Schema

**New Tables:**

```sql
-- Workflow definitions (configurable approval chains)
CREATE TABLE workflow_definitions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  entity_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'loan_application', 'disbursement', etc.
  version INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  stages JSONB NOT NULL, -- Array of stage definitions
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
);

-- Workflow instances (active approval processes)
CREATE TABLE workflow_instances (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  workflow_definition_id UUID REFERENCES workflow_definitions(id),
  entity_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL, -- approval_request.id or disbursement.id
  current_stage INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'in_progress', -- 'in_progress', 'completed', 'rejected', 'cancelled'
  started_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

  decision_notes TEXT,
  decided_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  decided_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Workflow configuration history (audit trail)
CREATE TABLE workflow_definition_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  workflow_definition_id UUID REFERENCES workflow_definitions(id),
  version INTEGER NOT NULL,
  stages JSONB NOT NULL,

- Record who viewed what when
- Generate compliance reports
- Audit log retention and archival

### Database Schema

**New Tables:**

```sql
-- Comprehensive audit log
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

  user_role TEXT,
  action TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'view', 'create', 'update', 'delete', 'approve', 'reject'
  entity_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'loan', 'approval_request', 'payment', 'user'
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL,
  old_state JSONB,
  new_state JSONB,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  session_id TEXT,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
);

-- View tracking (who viewed sensitive data)
CREATE TABLE view_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  entity_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL,
  view_duration_ms INTEGER,
  fields_viewed TEXT[], -- Array of field names
  ip_address INET,
  session_id TEXT
);

  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  report_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'monthly_approvals', 'user_activity', 'state_changes'
  period_start TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  period_end TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  generated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  generated_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  report_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  file_url TEXT -- Link to PDF/CSV export
);
```

### Audit Logging Strategy

**What to Log:**
1. All CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE operations
2. All approval/rejection decisions
3. All sensitive data views (PII, financial data)
4. All role assignments and permission changes
5. All workflow state transitions
6. Failed authentication attempts
7. Export/download operations

**What NOT to Log:**

**Backend:**
- [ ] Create audit tables with partitioning by month
- [ ] Build audit middleware for automatic logging
- [ ] Implement view tracking hooks
- [ ] Create compliance report generators
- [ ] Add audit log API endpoints (admin-only)

**Frontend:**
- [ ] Audit log viewer dashboard
- [ ] View tracking indicator (show who viewed)
- [ ] Compliance report builder
- [ ] Export audit logs to CSV/PDF

**Infrastructure:**
- [ ] Set up audit log retention policy (7 years)
- [ ] Implement log archival to cold storage
- [ ] Create backup strategy for audit data

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All state changes are logged with before/after snapshots
- [ ] View logs capture who accessed sensitive data
- [ ] Compliance reports generate within 60 seconds
- [ ] Audit logs are immutable (append-only)
- [ ] Admin can query logs by user, entity, action, date range
- [ ] Audit log retention meets regulatory requirements (7 years)
- [ ] Performance: <50ms overhead per logged operation
